		<div id="text-box"><p>10.2022, an ungodly hour at night: Hi this is my first journal entry and I'm honeslty doing better. I don't totally understand what I'm doing yet, but sitting down for an hour and focusing on this has been a great help in itself. So far I've coded the basics; a title, a menu with hrefs, and this journal page. I'm excited to continue updating this digital journal with my progress and see it grow!

			10.25.2022 OOOOOH! Today I looked up how to code glowing text in CSS and it took awhile but was totally worth it. I'm confused on how I exactly animated it, but it does that too which is great. I just followed the video and fiddled around with it.

			So techincally this website isn't pushed yet, because of issues with my terminal, so I'm writing in this digital notebook to myself like a crazy person. I developed the journal page a bit more but didn't have time to polish it or add anything fancy. Just made a menu bar and once again, befuddled, followed Molly's video. I don't understand the whole concept of sections yet. Oh well.
